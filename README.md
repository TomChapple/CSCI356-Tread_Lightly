# CSCI356 Group Assignment - Tread Lightly!

Hey guys, this is our group assignment for CSCI356: Game Engine Essentials at University of Wollongong.
We've been given a specific set of things we need to do, *but* it would be great it we could have something to set us apart.

## Group Members
- Tom Chapple
- Abraham Farrendy
- Brett Latham
- Alex Tan
- Matthew Twose

## Resources
We will be using Visual Studio 2012 as well as the Ogre suite we have been provided (including Bullet Physics and irrKlang).

In order for Git to work with  Visual Studio 2012, you'll need to go download the [Visual Studio Tools for Git](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/abafc7d6-dcaa-40f4-8a5e-d6724bdb980c), so make sure you download that before trying to connect to this repository. If you guys need any help, send up a message on our Facebook group and hopefully an answer will come up shortly.

Remember, you can only make changes to this project while you have a GitHub account, so make sure you get one setup.

## Check this out!
There's a Projects tab at the top when you are at the GitHub page which allows us to organise progress on this group assignment including being able to mark things as "In Progress" or "Get done quickly aaaaaa!".
